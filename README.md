## How to use it?

## Requirements

 - iPhone or iPad with an A12 chip or newer, running iOS 14. The LiDAR sensor is optional but recommended for better results.
 - 5 Ghz WiFi network (802.11ac).
 - A [compatible Quest VR application/game](Compatibility.md).

### Xcode

To build the app using your own developer account, create a `DeveloperSettings.xcconfig` config file inside `RealityMixer/` with your development team identifier and your organization identifier:

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID
ORGANIZATION_IDENTIFIER = com.yourcompany
```

## TO-DOs

 - [ ] Investigate the audio delay;

 - [ ] Improve the calibration screen and fix the positioning of the controller models;
 
 - [ ] Add a "green screen mode" that will allow the user to use the app with a regular green screen, allowing the app to run on devices without an A12 chip;
 
## Wishlist

These are features that could be implemented in the future:

 - Create a custom calibration app for the Quest to replace the Oculus MRC app, allowing the user to calibrate from VR itself;
 
 - Allow the user to adjust the FOV of the mixed reality capture;
 
 - Allow the app to cast the video output (although this should already be possible if you long press the "Screen recording" button on "Control Center" and then select a streaming app);
 
 - Android version;

## Credits

This project is based on the [Oculus MRC plugin for OBS](https://github.com/facebookincubator/obs-plugins/tree/master/oculus-mrc).

It uses [SwiftSocket](https://github.com/swiftsocket/SwiftSocket) to handle the TCP connection with the Oculus Quest, FFMPEG with Apple's VideoToolbox to decode the stream, and ARKit for the "virtual green screen". 

The right and left controller models are modified versions of the `oculus-touch-v3` models from the [WebXR Input Profiles](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-input-profiles).

This project also uses sounds from [Notification Sounds](https://notificationsounds.com) and avatars from [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/).
